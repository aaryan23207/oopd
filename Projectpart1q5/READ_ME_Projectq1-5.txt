# C++ Spectrum Management Program

This C++ program is designed to manage and analyze data related to spectrum allocation, subscriber information, and future data predictions for telecom companies.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. It uses standard C++ libraries, so no additional dependencies are required.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler:

    ```shell
    g++ main.cpp -o spectrum_manager
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```shell
    ./spectrum_manager
    ```

## Program Features

### Spectrum Range Analysis

The program can read spectrum range data from a CSV file and search for data based on a specific date. It displays details about the spectrum range, company, circle, and revenue.

### Subscriber Information

You can also analyze subscriber data from a CSV file. The program allows you to print all subscriber data or search for specific information based on a date, company, location, or the number of subscribers.

### Allocate Spectrum

This feature calculates the total spectrum and subscribers in a given area, then determines the current usage density. It also handles spectrum allocation requests and provides information on allocated spectrum.

### Future Data Prediction

The program analyzes past data to predict future trends. It calculates usage density and identifies areas where spectrum allocation is restricted.

### Search and Save Future Data

You can search for future data based on the company and location and save it to a file for later reference.

## Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions to use different program features. The program will guide you through data input and provide search options.
