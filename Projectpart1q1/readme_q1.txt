# C++ Telecom Spectrum Range Analyzer

This C++ program is designed to analyze telecom spectrum range data from a CSV file. It uses the "Projectq1-5.h" header file to define classes and structures for data analysis. Below, you'll find information on how to use this program.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. The program uses standard C++ libraries, so no additional dependencies are required.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```shell
    g++ main.cpp -o spectrum_range_analyzer
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```shell
    ./spectrum_range_analyzer
    ```

## Program Features

### Spectrum Range Data Analysis

- The program reads spectrum range data from a CSV file ("spectrumRange.csv").
- It allows you to search for data based on a specific date and provides details about the spectrum range, company, circle, and revenue.

## Usage
